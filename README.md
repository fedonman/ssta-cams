### Abstract

All Human, and not only, activities, are affected by the chemical composition of the air close to the surface of the Earth, generally referred as Air Quality (AQ). Low quality Air Exposure, affects a large percentage of human and animal population in the form of respiratory diseases and allergic responses. European commission is very sensitive with issues concerning public health and environment, and supports numerous efforts that describe and predict parameters and procedures that affect air quality. One of the most recent programme is the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).

The purpose of this guide is to provide individuals, not necessarily scientists, who are looking for the kind of data, that will allow them to create, defend or even debunk Legislation & Polices concerning factors that affect AQ, with the help of CAMS. In order to evaluate CAMS functionality three different factors affecting AQ are examined: dust aerosols, pollen, ozone and mononitrogen oxides.
