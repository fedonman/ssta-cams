\noindent\mdline{10}Some of today’s most important environmental concerns relate to the 
composition of the atmosphere. The increasing concentration of the 
greenhouse gases and the cooling effect of aerosol are prominent 
drivers of a changing climate, but the extent of their impact is 
often still uncertain.%mdk

%mdk-data-line={16}
\mdline{16}At the Earth’s surface, aerosols, ozone and other reactive gases such as 
nitrogen dioxide determine the quality of the air around us, affecting 
human health and life expectancy, the health of ecosystems and the 
fabric of the built environment. Ozone distributions in the stratosphere 
influence the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface. 
Dust, sand, smoke and volcanic aerosols affect the safe operation of 
transport systems and the availability of power from solar generation, 
the formation of clouds and rainfall, and the remote sensing by satellite 
of land, ocean and atmosphere.%mdk

%mdk-data-line={26}
\mdline{26}To address these environmental concerns there is a need for data and 
processed information. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) 
has been developed to meet these needs, aiming at supporting policymakers, 
business and citizens with enhanced atmospheric environmental information.%mdk
